            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To assemble the lasagna</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put pasta water on to boil:</li>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.</p>
            <p> It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
            <li>Brown the ground beef:</li>
            <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat.</p>
            <p>Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
            <p>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl.</p>
            <p>Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
            <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</li>
            <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</p>
            <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.</p>
            <p>Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</p>
            <p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan.</p>
            <p>Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
            <li>Make the sauce:</li>
            <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot.</p>
            <p>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>
            <p>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste</p>
            <p>Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste.</p>
            <p>(The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)</p>
            <p>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.</p>
            <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer.</p>
            <p>Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often.</p>
            <p>Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
            <p>Remove from heat.</p>
            <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</li>
            <p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. </p>
            <p>Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.</p>
            <p>Stir often to prevent from sticking. </p>
            <p>Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.</p>
            <p>When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>
            <p>Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil.</p>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna:</li>
            <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. </p>
            <p>Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce.</p>
            <p>Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. </p>
            <p>Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.</p>
            <p>Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce.</p>
            <p>Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.</p>
            <p>Finish with another layer of noodles.</p>
            <p> Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</p>
            <li>Bake:</li>
            <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce).</p>
            <p>Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>
            <li>Cool and serve:</li>
            <p>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving.</p>
        </ol>
